# Research Findings: Food Vendor TikTok Clone

## TikTok UI Design Principles

Based on research from CareerFoundry's analysis of TikTok's UI success, the key principles are:

### 1. Swiping (Fitts's Law)
- **Large, close targets**: Swiping gives users a target that's as big and close as possible
- **Thumb-friendly**: Whether holding phone with left, right, or both hands, swiping is always easy
- **Primary action optimization**: Since scrolling to next video is the most common action, making it effortless is crucial
- **Addictive by design**: Easy swiping creates an "incomparably addictive experience"

### 2. Simplicity (Hick's Law)
- **Minimal choices**: Fewer options prevent analysis paralysis
- **Immediate value**: New users are shown a video immediately, no product tour needed
- **Frictionless experience**: Everything can be achieved intuitively in a few clicks
- **Barrier removal**: Lower barriers for content creation leads to more content

### 3. No Thinking (Miller's Law)
- **Low cognitive load**: Average person can only hold 5-9 items in working memory
- **Thumb zone optimization**: Key actions (follow, like, comment, share) are in the right sidebar thumb zone
- **Clear visual hierarchy**: Icons designed not to blend with video background
- **Vertical stacking**: Makes actions easy to perform between main scrolling action

### 4. Instant Rewards (Doherty Threshold)
- **Sub-400ms response**: Users should see response in less than 400ms to feel in control
- **Instant content loading**: New content loads immediately (when network allows)
- **User control feeling**: Easy to swipe past unengaging content
- **Influence feedback**: Users know their actions (like, comment, share) affect what they see
